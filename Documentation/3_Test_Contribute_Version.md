# Test, Contribute, and Version

## Testing
- **Postman** was used to test the APIs ensuring the correct response and debugging any errors.
- **CirclCI** was used to run all tests before a branch was merged to master.

## Contributing
1. Submit an issue (eg. feature request or bug)
2. Create a branch: git checkout -b branchName
3. Commit changes to the branch: git add . && git commit -m "commit message"
4. Push the changes: git push -u origin branchName/main
5. Submit a pull request

## Versioning

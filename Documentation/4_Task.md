# Summer 2021 Shopify Developer Intern Challenge

You can save your work in a text file, link, etc. and have it ready with you for your technical interview (you can also
add it on GitHub).

### TASK: Build an image repository.

You can tackle this challenge using any technology you want. This is an open-ended task.

Please provide brief instructions on how to use your application.

Extra Information: You can, if you wish, use frameworks, libraries and external dependencies to help you get faster to
the parts you are interested in building, if this helps you; or start from scratch.

Please focus on what interests you the most. If you need inspiration, here are examples of what you can work on. IF you
work on these ideas, we recommend choosing only one or two.

- from characteristics of the images
